Hey👋, I'm Guillaume Noblet

A (humanitarian) researcher specialized in field research and data visualization.

Previously, I was a Data & Research Specialist at IMPACT Initiatives.

I'm a (humanitarian) quantitative researcher who loves a good meme almost as much as bouncing ideas around with others. Whether I'm trying to make sense of messy data or just swapping stories about bits of history, I genuinely enjoy taking complicated things and making them a little clearer—for others, and honestly, for myself too. And if we can share a laugh or two along the way, even better.
✨ Things I'm good at, enjoy, and feel somewhat passionate about

    Research & Analysis: statistical analysis, economic modeling, data structuration, data visualization, household surveys
    Project Management: horizontal project management, capacity building, co-training
    Technical Toolbox:
    R (Tidyverse, Shiny, data.table, sf, tmap),
    Python (Pandas, Polars, Matplotlib, Plotnine),
    QGIS, Kobo Toolbox
    Interests: data visualization, open source projects, community resilience, participatory approaches, socio-ecological analysis

🚀 My Latest Projects
