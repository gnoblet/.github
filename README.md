I'm a (humanitarian) quantitative researcher who loves a good meme almost as much as bouncing ideas around with others. Whether I'm trying to make sense of messy data or just swapping stories about bits of history, I genuinely enjoy taking complicated things and making them a little clearer‚Äîfor others, and honestly, for myself too. And if we can share a laugh or two along the way, even better.

## ‚ú® Things I'm good at, enjoy, and feel somewhat passionate about

- **Research & Analysis**: statistical analysis, economic modeling, data structuration, data visualization, household surveys
- **Project Management**: horizontal project management, capacity building, co-training
- **Technical Toolbox**:  
  R (Tidyverse, Shiny, data.table, sf, tmap),  
  Python (Pandas, Polars, Matplotlib, Plotnine),  
  QGIS, Kobo Toolbox
- **Interests**: data visualization, open source projects, community resilience, participatory approaches, socio-ecological analysis
